{"name":"SS","tagline":"Automatically finds subtitles for multiple movies using OpenSubtitle.org APIs","body":"# Subtitle Searcher - SS #\r\n\r\n## Introduction ##\r\n\r\nThis is a command line script that automatically searches for video \r\nsubtitles using [OpenSubtitles.org](http://www.opensubtitles.org ) APIs.\r\n\r\nOne advantage is that it can automatically search for all videos inside a directory, making it \r\neasy to download subtitles for TV shows packs. Also, it can usually be configured by any download \r\nmanager to automatically execute it when a movie or video finishes.\r\n\r\n**Latest Release**: [1.1.0](https://github.com/nicoddemus/ss/releases/tag/1.1.0)\r\n\r\n## Requirements ##\r\n\r\nPython 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and PyPy. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\nJust pass the name of the video file or a directory, in which case it will\r\nsearch for all video files in that directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    ] python ss.py Parks.and.Recreation.S05E13.HDTV.x264-LOL.mp4 The.Mentalist.S05E14.HDTV.x264-LOL.mp4\r\n    Language: eng\r\n    Querying OpenSubtitles.org for 2 file(s)...\r\n    \r\n    - Parks.and.Recreation.S05E13.HDTV.x264-LOL.mp4                       OK\r\n    - The.Mentalist.S05E14.HDTV.x264-LOL.mp4                              OK\r\n    \r\n    Downloading...\r\n     - Parks.and.Recreation.S05E13.HDTV.x264-LOL.srt                      DONE\r\n     - The.Mentalist.S05E14.HDTV.x264-LOL.srt                             DONE\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIt will try to find the best match online, and automatically download and rename the subtitles.\r\n\r\nTo change language and other options, use `--config` (or `-c`). For instance, to change \r\nthe language to Brazillian Portuguese and enable searching for files recursively, use:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    ] python ss.py --config language=pob recursive=1\r\n    language=pob\r\n    recursive=1\r\n    skip=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following options are available:\r\n\r\n* `language:` 3 letter code with the language to search subtitles for. Use the same code as it \r\n  appears when you change search languages (as in http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-pob).\r\n\r\n* `recursive`: if directories should be recursively searched for movies.\r\n\r\n* `skip`: if movies that already have subtitles should be skipped. If this is 0 and a movie \r\n  already has subtitles, `ss` won't overwrite the current subtitle, but generate a file using\r\n  the language as suffix; if that also already exists, it will use an additional *\"ss\"* prefix.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support ##\r\n\r\nIf you find any issues (not finding subtitles for a specific movie, errors, etc.), please report it in the \r\n[issues page](https://github.com/nicoddemus/ss/issues).\r\n\r\n## Continuous Integration ##\r\n\r\nThis project runs a Continuous Integration job at [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/nicoddemus/ss)!\r\n\r\nCurrent Build Status: ![ci](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nicoddemus/ss.png?branch=master)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
